The application layer is the top layer of the Android platform architecture. The Android operating system provides a decent number of built-in applications for fundamental user needs such as contacts, calling, web browsing, email, SMS, calendars, and more \cite{7}. These built-in applications are developed by the Android team. In addition to these built-in applications, there are also third-party applications that are developed by third-party providers. All these applications are installed in the application layer. Android provides the flexibility for developers to write applications that can replace any built-in application provided by the Android operating system. This study focuses on the best practices to develop the maintainable and testable state-of-the-art Android applications that will be installed in the application layer.
