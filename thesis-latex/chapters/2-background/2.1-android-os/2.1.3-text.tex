This layer includes a variety of C/C++ core libraries and Java libraries. The purpose of this layer is to provide support for core features. Important system components of Android, such as HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and ART (Android Runtime) depend heavily on the native libraries that are written on C/C++ programming languages \cite{7}. Some of the important native libraries are Camera, Media, OpenGL, SQLite, WebKit, SurfaceManager, etc.
