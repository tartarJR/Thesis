The very core of the Android platform is the Linux Kernel and the base infrastructure of the Android heavily depends on the Linux. Using Linux comes with some advantages. Firstly, using a well-known kernel enables device providers to work on a platform that they already recognize, and second Android benefits from the Linux system and kernel security \cite{7}. This layer also provides all the hardware drivers for camera, display, etc., and handles battery management and other system-related properties.
