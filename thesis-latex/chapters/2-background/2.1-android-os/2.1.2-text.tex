The Android operating system's APIs written in Java programming language are provided through this layer. These APIs are the core building blocks for the developers in order to develop Android applications. A couple of noticeable key core building blocks include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item View System: It provides an extensible set of views for creating user interfaces and user experience.
\item Resource Manager: Providing tools for accessing and managing non-code embedded application resources such as strings, colors, values, layouts, images, etc.
\item Activity Manager: It provides the tools for managing the application lifecycle and navigation back stack.
\item Content Providers: It provides tools for enabling data sharing between different applications.
\item Notification Manager: It provides tools for developers to add the ability of notifications and alerts for Android applications.
\item Location Manager: Provides tools for developers to manage location-related data and location updates.
\end{itemize}
The practices that will be covered in this study mainly occur on this layer because the code is developed and structured in the Java API Framework layer.
