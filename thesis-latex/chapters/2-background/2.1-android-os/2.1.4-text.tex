Android Runtime(ART) is a runtime environment for applications that run on the Android operating system. With the launch of Android Version 5.0 or in other words, API level 21, the Dalvik virtual machine was replaced with Android Runtime. Since then, every application started running on its own process along with its own instance of ART \cite{7}.
