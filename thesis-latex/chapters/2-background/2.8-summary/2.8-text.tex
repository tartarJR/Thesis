In this section, a set of essential information regarding software engineering and Android platform information was shared, and the motivation of the study was covered. The purpose of sharing fundamental software engineering principles such as maintainability and SOLID principles is to shine a light on the background of this study's problem and facilitate understanding of the problem that this study is trying to solve. Again, with the same purpose, necessary information about the Android platform was also shared. The insights of maintainability issues in software development and the consequences of software development complexity issues were covered and interpreted in general. It was also indicated why the challenges get even more complicated when it comes to Android application development. Lastly, the conducted multivocal systematic review of the existing academic papers was shared and interpreted as part of this study.
