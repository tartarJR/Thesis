This section starts with brief insights from the Android environment and Android application components in order to provide information about the nature of the Android environment and Android applications. With the light of this information, the study aims to facilitate the understanding of difficulties arising from Android's nature. The section continues by describing some fundamental software engineering concepts, including maintainability and software architecture, which the solutions when solving difficulties encountered when developing Android applications are mostly influenced. Besides, the importance of these concepts in software engineering and particularly in Android application development is explained. The section concludes by presenting the white and gray literature review results. Through all this information, it is aimed to facilitate understanding of the foundation sources of the main problems that developers often encounter in Android application development processes, which were discussed in more detail in the "Problem Statement" section. It is also another goal for readers to be familiar with the basic principles of software engineering, which is the starting point of possible methods used in solving these problems.
