Android is an open-source operating system for mobile devices. The Android project was initially created by the Open Handset Alliance which includes organizations from various industries such as Google, Vodafone, T-Mobile, LG, Huawei, Asus, Acer, and eBay to give some examples \footnote{\url{http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/oha_members.html}}. The main goal of the Android project is to provide an open software platform accessible for a variety of stakeholders such as developers, engineers, carriers, and device manufacturers to turn their innovative and imaginative ideas into successful real-world products that improve the mobile experience for the end-users. Today, numerous organizations from Open Handset Alliance and also other organizations are supporting and investing in Android and the project is led by Google. Android is designed in a distributed way to avoid the issue of the central point of failure. In another means, different industry players confine or control the advancements of another. As a result, a production-quality consumer product comes along with open source code that is ready for customization.
