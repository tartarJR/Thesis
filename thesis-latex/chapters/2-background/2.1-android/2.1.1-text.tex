Android is an open-source operating system for mobile devices such as mobile phones, tablets, IoT devices and so on. The Android project was initially created by the Open Handset Alliance which includes organizations from various industries such as Google, Vodafone, T-Mobile, LG, Huawei, Asus, Acer, and eBay to give some examples\footnote{\url{http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/oha_members.html}}. The main goal of the Android project is to provide an open software platform accessible for a variety of stakeholders such as developers, engineers, carriers, and device manufacturers to turn their innovative and imaginative ideas into successful real-world products that improve the mobile experience for the end-users. Today, numerous organizations from Open Handset Alliance and also other organizations are supporting and investing in Android and the project is led by Google.
