A literature review was carried out within the scope of this study to examine previous studies conducted on the maintainability of Android applications and obtain more comprehensive information on maintainability measurement. Considering the tight relationship between the topic and industry, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was not found sufficent for finding relevant resources of data for the study. Hence, a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted. As a type of SLR, MLR is collecting grey literature as well alongside formal literature \cite{40}. MLR considers resources like blogs, books, articles, academic literature and allows gathering information from academics, developers, practitioners, and independent researchers \cite{41}.
