As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:conduction_period}, participation in the survey took place only during specific periods of this one-year term. Although the questionnaire accepted answers for a year-long, it was boosted in different periods,  as shown in the histogram above. It would be logical to consider this situation while examining the response numbers.
