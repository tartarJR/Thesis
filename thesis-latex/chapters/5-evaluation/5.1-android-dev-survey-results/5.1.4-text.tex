The second question of the survey asks Android developers the programming language or programming languages they use to develop Android applications. As mentioned in section 2, different programming languages can be used while developing Android applications. Nevertheless, this study focuses solely on "Native" Android development, as mentioned many times before. Therefore, only Java and Kotlin programming languages are among the options offered to answer the second question.

In Fig. \ref{fig:programming_languages} above, Android developers' trends regarding the programming language they use while developing "Native" Android applications can be seen. Around 47\% of the Android developers surveyed seem to use the Kotlin programming language. 40\% of the participants use Java and Kotlin together, while only 13.1\% use the Java programming language.
