The second step of the qualitative evaluations carried out within this studyâ€™s scope is the interviews conducted with Mooncascade's Android team members. Unlike the Android developer survey that was explained in the previous section, these interviews are designed and conducted to qualitatively evaluate the techniques and technologies used by Mooncascade's Android team in terms of maintainability. Also, the interviews aim to determine the importance of maintainability from the case company's point of view.  Thus, proving or disproving the study's claim that maintainability is a key concept to overcome the issues mentioned in the problem statement section would be possible. Eight questions were determined for this purpose. The interview questions can be accessed publicly\footnote{\url{https://forms.gle/paMSj5e8Up5ZW6raA}}. Three main criteria were taken into consideration while preparing these questions. First of all, questions were chosen to get to know about the participants' background and experience. Later, some questions were designed to learn participants' understanding of maintainability in software engineering. Lastly, questions were drafted to learn about participants' thoughts about the impact of technologies and principles used by Mooncascade on maintainability. The interview was conducted privately with each team member.  It is aimed that the data gathered through these interviews will support the accuracy and validity of evaluations.
