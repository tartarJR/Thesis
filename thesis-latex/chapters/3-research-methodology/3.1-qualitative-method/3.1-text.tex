When other academic studies dealing with the measurement of maintainability of software systems are reviewed, it was seen that many studies use quantitative methods. For example, Verdecchia et al. researched this topic\cite{14}. Although it cannot be claimed that such quantitative measurements are inaccurate, it would not be wrong to say that these measures are inadequate at times. It is essential to make qualitative evaluations and quantitative evaluations to increase the efficiency of the evaluations. In this way, it may be possible to measure developers' experiences and their effects on maintainability. For these reasons, an Android developer survey and interviews were conducted within this study's scope. This section covers these qualitative methods.
