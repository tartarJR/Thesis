The first step of qualitative evaluations in this study is the Android developer survey. The consistency and stability of principles and third-party libraries used in Android applications indirectly affect the maintainability of applications. Therefore, although it does not directly contribute to measuring maintainability, this survey was conducted to identify current Android trends and provide support for this study's evaluation. While determining this survey's questions, priority was given to principles and technologies that directly and indirectly affect maintainability. Although the questions are generally prepared to cover the methods used by the Mooncascade Android's team, it can be said that the questions reflect the Android technology stack in general. The content of the survey can be accessed publicly\footnote{\url{https://forms.gle/MoiTGMV874yzJwuv8}}. The questions are organised with the help of the Forms application provided by Google. The Android developer survey has been delivered to Android developers from different companies in different countries through accounts or groups of Android developer communities on social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Discord, and Twitter. The author of the study has also shared the survey with many of his colleagues/ex-colleagues working in different companies/countries.
