As stated before, this study focuses on evaluating the techniques and technologies used by Mooncascade's Android team from the maintainability point of view. In this section, the methods to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques and technologies are explained. These evaluation methods are both quantitative and qualitative. In this way, it is aimed to evaluate with maximum efficiency by going beyond the traditional quantitative measurement techniques. Also, why and how these methods are chosen are explained in this section. Thus, the first research question is answered.
