The methods and third-party libraries used in the development of Android applications, which are mentioned in this study, are well-known by the Android community. However, there is not enough empirical data about the impact of these practices and third-party libraries on an important software development concept such as maintainability. The author contributes to understanding how Android application codebases can be measured in terms of maintainability and providing empirical data on the impact of the well known Android development methods and technologies on maintainability.
