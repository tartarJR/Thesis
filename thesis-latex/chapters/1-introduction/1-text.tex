In the last decade, the impact of smartphones on our lives has significantly increased, and smartphones and mobile applications became people's primary way of interacting with technology. This situation has made the applications that work on these smartphones a vital part of daily and business life, from ordinary people to large companies. Today, mobile applications have become one of the most critical parts of digitalisation. Notably, as a successful open-source mobile operating system, Android has been a core element of this change, and the demand for Android applications has increased. Android application development has become one of the most necessary parts of the business area with a significant market share. Today, there are more than 2.5 billion active Android devices in the world \cite{1}. Therefore, it is difficult to ignore the importance of Android application development.
However, the increasing importance of the mobile era also brought more challenges to mobile application development and Android application development.

Mooncascade is a  product development company based in Estonia. The company provides different software development services to its clients, including Android development. With the increasing demand for mobile applications, the company has been facing various challenges when providing Android application development services to different customers from different fields during the development process of Android applications. These difficulties can be examined under four major topics. Android's platform-specific complexity, sophisticated business needs, the frequent update rate of Android applications, and, lastly, growing codebases and fast-changing development teams. To overcome these challenges, "maintainability" emerges as one of the most important non-functional requirements for this purpose. Developing maintainable Android applications is the way to survive in the competitive market quickly and cost-effectively. 

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Android development methods and technologies used by Mooncascade in terms of maintainability. To that aim, both qualitative analyses (via interviews and surveys) and quantitative analysis (via object-oriented software quality metrics) are conducted. The main motivation for this study is to eliminate the problems arising from the lack of maintainability in Android application development and, thus, improve developer/team efficiency and provide time and cost-efficient solutions to the clients. The target audience of this study includes Android developers and researchers who are already experienced with Android application development basics. The study only focuses on native Android application development.
 
The author contributed to understanding how Android application codebases can be measured in terms of maintainability and providing empirical data on the impact of the well known Android development methods and technologies on maintainability.
