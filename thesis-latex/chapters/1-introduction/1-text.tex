In the last decade, the impact of smartphones on our lives has significantly increased, and smartphones and mobile applications became people's primary way of interacting with technology. This situation has made the applications that work on these smartphones a vital part of daily and business life, from ordinary people to large companies. Today, mobile applications have become one of the most critical parts of digitalisation. Notably, as a successful open-source mobile operating system, Android has been a core element of this change, and the demand for Android applications has increased. Android application development has become one of the most necessary parts of the business area with a significant market share. Today, there are more than 2.5 billion active Android devices in the world \cite{1}. Therefore, it is difficult to ignore the importance of Android application development.
However, the increasing importance of the mobile era also brought more challenges to mobile application development and Android application development. Designing, developing, testing and understanding Android applications is becoming more complex \cite{34}. These challenges can be examined under four major topics. These are Androidâ€™s nature and its platform-specific components, sophisticated business needs, the frequent update rate of Android applications, and lastly, changing development teams. 

Mooncascade is a  product development company based in Estonia. The company provides different software development services to its clients, including Android development. With the increasing demand for Android applications, the company has been facing the previously mentioned challenges when providing Android application development services to different customers from different fields during the development process of Android applications. To overcome these challenges, "maintainability" emerges as one of the most important non-functional requirements. In the context of software engineering, "maintainability" is the ease with which a system or component can be modified for use in applications or environments other than those for which it was specifically designed \cite{20}. Developing maintainable Android applications is the way to survive in the competitive market time and cost-effectively \cite{50}. However, achieving this goal is challenging and costly \cite{34}.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of the methods and technologies used by Mooncascade when developing Android applications in terms of maintainability. Although evaluating software maintainability is not hard, the ways to be used are vast and choosing a suitable method might be challenging. Different methods and software metrics can be used to estimate the software maintainability value \cite{34,23,26,33,36,45}. For that purpose, this study follows the triangulation strategy \cite{51}. Both qualitative analyses (via interviews and surveys) and quantitative analysis (via object-oriented software quality metrics) are conducted. This method is preferred to collect data from different resources (academic resources and Android community) for obtaining more coherent results. The main motivation of this study is to find proper methods and technologies for developing maintainable applications to eliminate the four major problems in Android application development mentioned above. Thus improving developer/team efficiency and providing time and cost-efficient solutions to the clients. The study only focuses on native Android application development.
