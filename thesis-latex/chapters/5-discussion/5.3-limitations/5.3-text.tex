%On the other hand, considering that there may be deficiencies in the methods used in the evaluations, the necessity to carry out more detailed studies on how to evaluate maintainability better and how to develop Android applications in terms of maintainability is obvious.

%First of all, it should be stated that the features used in quantitative evaluations are relatively less complex features of the Android application. Therefore the efficiency of evaluation and comparison was affected by this situation. Using more complex feature could provide better insight into the impact of the methods and technologies used by the case company. Unfortunately, this was not possible within the scope of this study due to a lack of features and time to develop more complex features. However, it is true that using relatively less complicated features while making the assessment slightly reduces the results' effectiveness. Still, it does not mean that these results are false or unrealistic.
