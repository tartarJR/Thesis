In this chapter, the methods to evaluate the impact of the techniques and technologies used by the case company on maintainabilty are explained. This study follows the triangulation strategy \cite{51}. This strategy is applied by conducting two different methods within the scope of this study. These methods are quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Quantitative evaluation is made using object-oriented software maintainability metrics, and qualitative evaluation was made via interviews and surveys with Android developers. In this way collecting data from different resources is ensured, and more coherent results can be obtained. Another reason for using this method is that the study subject is closely related to the industry. Due to this close relationship, it is predicted that qualitative evaluations of the Android community and Android developers could increase the accuracy of this study. Thus, maximum efficiency by going beyond the traditional quantitative measurement techniques is aimed. Also, why and how these methods are chosen are explained in this chapter. Hence, the first research question is answered.
